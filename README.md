Final Project on Electric Cars different countries.
Electric vehicles are becoming a major part of the global shift toward cleaner and smarter transportation. This project looks at how different countries are adopting electric cars and what factors are helping or slowing them down. Each country has its own policies, technology, and challenges, which makes the EV transition look very different around the world. By comparing these differences, we can understand what works, what doesn’t, and why some places move faster than others. The goal of this presentation is to give a clear overview of global EV trends and highlight what we can learn from each country’s approach.
There are 3 folders 
My project is organized into three main folders to keep everything clean and easy to follow.
The first folder, Data and Method, holds all the raw information I used and explains how I collected and analyzed the data for electric cars in different countries.
The second folder, Visualization with Final Findings, includes the charts, graphs, and visual summaries that show the results of my analysis in a clear way.
The third folder, Business Case Report, brings everything together by explaining what the data means, why it matters, and how different countries are approaching electric vehicle adoption from a business and policy standpoint.
